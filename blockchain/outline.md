## Section 1: Blockchain Fundamentals

### Lesson 1.1: Introduction to Blockchain

#### What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers or nodes in a transparent and secure manner. It involves key concepts like blocks, transactions, and nodes.

#### Evolution of blockchain technology
The development of blockchain technology can be traced back to early concepts and predecessors. Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper on Bitcoin in 2008 introduced blockchain to the world, and since then, alternative blockchain platforms have emerged.

#### Key concepts and terminology
To understand blockchain, it's essential to grasp key concepts and familiarize yourself with associated terminology, including cryptography, nodes, consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, immutability, transparency, and security.

### Lesson 1.2: How a Blockchain Works

#### Distributed ledger technology
Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is the foundation of blockchain. It enables multiple participants to maintain a synchronized and shared database. DLT operates on a peer-to-peer network and ensures consensus among nodes.

#### Consensus mechanisms: Proof of Work and Proof of Stake
Consensus mechanisms play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and security of a blockchain. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are popular consensus mechanisms with different approaches.

#### Mining and block formation
Mining is the process of adding new blocks to the blockchain. Miners collect and validate transactions, bundle them into blocks, and compete to solve mathematical puzzles to add the block to the blockchain. Each block contains a header, a list of transactions, and a unique identifier (hash).

#### Transaction validation and security
Transactions in a blockchain undergo validation to ensure their legitimacy. Nodes verify signatures, check available funds, and ensure compliance with the blockchain's rules. Security in blockchain is achieved through cryptography, consensus mechanisms, decentralization, and immutability.
