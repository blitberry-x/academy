### Lesson 2.1: Overview of Popular Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention and adoption in recent years. In this lesson, we will explore some of the most popular cryptocurrencies and understand their functionalities and roles within the blockchain ecosystem.

#### Bitcoin

Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It was created by an anonymous person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network called the Bitcoin blockchain, which allows users to send and receive digital currency without the need for intermediaries like banks. Bitcoin is often seen as a store of value and a medium of exchange, with its underlying technology, blockchain, providing transparency and security.

#### Ethereum

Ethereum is a blockchain platform that introduced the concept of smart contracts. It enables developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and execute programmable transactions without the need for intermediaries. Ethereum has its native cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH), which serves as fuel for executing transactions and running smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Ethereum's ability to support smart contracts has paved the way for the development of various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other innovative use cases.

#### Solana

Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and crypto-native projects. It aims to provide fast and scalable solutions by utilizing a combination of innovative technologies, including proof of history (PoH) and proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. Solana's native cryptocurrency is called SOL, which is used for transactions and participating in the network's consensus process. Solana has gained popularity for its ability to handle a high volume of transactions quickly and at low fees, making it suitable for applications requiring high throughput.

#### Roles in the Blockchain Ecosystem

Each cryptocurrency plays a unique role within the blockchain ecosystem. Bitcoin, as the pioneer, has established itself as a digital store of value and a decentralized alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Ethereum, with its smart contract capabilities, has revolutionized the development of decentralized applications and enabled the creation of new digital assets and financial instruments. Solana, as a high-performance blockchain, offers scalability and fast transaction processing, making it attractive for various applications requiring speed and efficiency.

Understanding the functionalities and roles of these popular cryptocurrencies provides a solid foundation for further exploration of blockchain technology and its applications.

#### How cryptocurrencies function on a lower level

Delving deeper, this lesson explains how cryptocurrencies function on a lower level, including the underlying technologies and protocols that enable their operation.

### Lesson 2.2: Exploring Tokens and NFTs

#### Tokens: coins vs. tokens

This lesson explores the distinction between tokens and coins within the blockchain context. It covers their different use cases and functionalities.

#### Introduction to ERC-20 tokens

ERC-20 tokens are widely used in the blockchain space. This lesson introduces ERC-20 tokens, their standards, and their role in various applications.

#### Pegged tokens and value retention

This lesson explains pegged tokens, which are tokens tied to the value of a particular asset. It covers how value retention is achieved and the benefits it brings.

#### Introduction to ERC-721 tokens (NFTs)

ERC-721 tokens, also known as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), have gained significant popularity. This lesson introduces the concept of NFTs, their uniqueness, and their role in the digital art and collectibles space.

#### Non-fungible tokens and ownership proof

This lesson explores the characteristics of non-fungible tokens and how they provide ownership proof in various domains, including digital art, gaming, and real-world assets.
