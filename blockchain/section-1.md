## Lesson 1.1: Introduction to Blockchain

Content:

### What is blockchain?
Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers or nodes in a transparent and secure manner. It consists of blocks, transactions, and nodes. The key characteristics of blockchain are decentralization, immutability, transparency, and security.

### Evolution of blockchain technology
The development of blockchain technology can be traced back to early concepts and predecessors, such as cryptographic techniques, digital cash, and distributed computing. The introduction of blockchain to the world came with Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper on Bitcoin in 2008. Since then, alternative blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Solana have emerged, bringing new innovations and advancements.

### Key concepts and terminology
To understand blockchain, it's important to grasp key concepts and familiarize yourself with the associated terminology. Some essential terms include:
- Cryptography: The use of cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and data within a blockchain.
- Nodes: Computers or devices that participate in the blockchain network, store a copy of the blockchain, and validate transactions.
- Consensus mechanisms: Algorithms or protocols that ensure agreement among nodes in the network, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS).
- Smart contracts: Self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions, stored on the blockchain and automatically executed when triggered.
- Immutable: The inability to alter or tamper with data once it is recorded on the blockchain.
- Transparency: All transactions on the blockchain are visible to participants, promoting trust and accountability.
- Security: The use of cryptography, consensus mechanisms, and decentralized architecture to protect against fraud and unauthorized modifications.

### Distributed ledger technology
Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is the foundation of blockchain. It enables multiple participants to maintain a synchronized and shared database. DLT operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, where nodes communicate and share data directly without the need for intermediaries. Synchronization and consensus mechanisms ensure that all nodes have a consistent copy of the ledger.

### Consensus mechanisms: Proof of Work and Proof of Stake
Consensus mechanisms play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and security of a blockchain. Two popular consensus mechanisms are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS):
- Proof of Work (PoW) requires nodes, known as miners, to solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. Miners are rewarded for their computational work.
- Proof of Stake (PoS) selects validators to create new blocks based on their ownership or stake in the blockchain network. Validators are rewarded with transaction fees.

### Mining and block formation
Mining is the process by which new blocks are added to the blockchain. Miners collect and validate transactions, bundle them into blocks, and compete to solve a mathematical puzzle. The first miner to solve the puzzle adds the block to the blockchain and receives a reward. Each block contains a header, a list of transactions, and a unique identifier (hash). The header includes metadata like the previous block's hash, timestamp, and nonce.

### Transaction validation and security
Transactions in a blockchain undergo validation to ensure their legitimacy. Nodes verify signatures, check available funds, and ensure compliance with the blockchain's rules. Validated transactions are added to blocks and become part of the blockchain's permanent record. The security of a blockchain is achieved through cryptography, consensus mechanisms, decentralization, immutability, and resistance to tampering or unauthorized modifications.
